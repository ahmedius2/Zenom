System Requirements
==========================

For the current version of Zenom, you will also need Xenomai 
version 2.6.2, Qt version 4.8.4, Qwt version 6.0.1, and 
OpenSceneGraph version 3.0.1 installed on your system. 


Building Zenom
==========================

Zenom uses qmake to build all its components and examples. 

If you don't already have qmake installed on your system you can grab 
it from http://qt-project.org, use version 4.8.4 or later. 

    qmake-qt4
    make
    make install

If you have installed a shared library it's path has to be known to 
the run-time linker of your operating system. On Linux systems read
"man ldconfig" ( or google for it ). Another option is to use
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

Good luck !
